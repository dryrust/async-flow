_"Τὰ πάντα ῥεῖ καὶ οὐδὲν μένει" — Heraclitus_

**Async abstractions for [flow-based programming] (FBP) in Rust.**
This crate can be used to implement dataflow systems consisting of
reusable, interconnected blocks that process arbitrary messages.

> [!TIP]
> 🚧 _We are building in public. This is presently under heavy construction._

## ✨ Features

- Provides primitives for flow-based programming (FBP) based on [Tokio].
- Constructs data flows by connecting reusable components called blocks.
- Compatible with the inventory of blocks provided by the [Flows.rs] project.
- Supports opting out of any feature using comprehensive feature flags.
- Adheres to the Rust API Guidelines in its [naming conventions].
- Cuts red tape: 100% free and unencumbered public domain software.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 1.85+ (2024 edition)

## ⬇️ Installation

### Installation via Cargo

```bash
cargo add async-flow
```

## 👉 Examples

### Importing the Library

```rust
use async_flow::*;
```

### Composing Systems

#### Reading from stdin and writing to stdout

```rust
use async_flow::{Inputs, Outputs, Result, System};

#[tokio::main(flavor = "current_thread")]
pub async fn main() -> Result {
    System::run(|s| {
        let stdin = s.read_stdin::<f64>();
        let stdout = s.write_stdout::<f64>();
        s.spawn(sqrt(stdin, stdout));
    })
    .await
}

/// A block that computes the square root of input numbers.
async fn sqrt(mut inputs: Inputs<f64>, outputs: Outputs<f64>) -> Result {
    while let Some(input) = inputs.recv().await? {
        let output = input.sqrt();
        outputs.send(output).await?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### Implementing Blocks

#### Implementing a `split_string` block

```rust
use async_flow::{Inputs, Outputs, Result};

/// A block that splits input strings based on a delimiter.
async fn split_string(delim: &str, mut inputs: Inputs<String>, outputs: Outputs<String>) -> Result {
    while let Some(input) = inputs.recv().await? {
        for output in input.split(delim) {
            outputs.send(output.into()).await?;
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Implementing an `add_ints` block

```rust
use async_flow::{Inputs, Outputs, Result};

/// A block that outputs the sums of input numbers.
async fn add_ints(mut lhs: Inputs<i64>, mut rhs: Inputs<i64>, sums: Outputs<i64>) -> Result {
    loop {
        let (a, b) = tokio::try_join!(lhs.recv(), rhs.recv())?;
        match (a, b) {
            (Some(a), Some(b)) => sums.send(a + b).await?,
            _ => break,
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## 📚 Reference

[docs.rs/async-flow](https://docs.rs/async-flow)

### Glossary

- **System**: A collection of blocks that are connected together.
  Systems are the top-level entities in dataflow programs.

- **Block**: An encapsulated system component that processes messages.
  Blocks are the autonomous units of computation in a system.

- **Port**: A named connection point on a block that sends or receives
  messages. Ports are the only interfaces through which blocks communicate
  with each other.

- **Message**: A unit of data that flows between blocks in a system, from port
  to port. Any Rust type that implements the `Send + Sync + 'static` traits can
  be used as a message.

## 👨‍💻 Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/artob/async-flow.git
